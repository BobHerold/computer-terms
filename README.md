# Computer Terms

This was created for my third Milestone Project as a student of the Code Institute's (https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Developer course.
It is directly based on the Task-Manager application that we built as a mini project from the Data Centric module from the Code Institute.

  1. Create Procfile, which tells Heroku which file runs the app and how to run it.
  2. From the Heroku dashboard, click on the connect to Github button.
  3. In the Heroku settings tab, select Reveal Config Vars, to tell Heroku which variables are required to run the app, such as IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME.
  4. From the Deploy tab in Heroku, select Enable Automatic Deploys, Deploy the proper branch, or master.
  5. Select View, to launch the app, and Heroku will now build the app using the required packages.
